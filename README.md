## ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ 30 July 2025

My first day at GNDEC began with a peaceful **kirtan** at the gurdwara (8:30 AM), followed by tea and snacks.  
In the auditorium, our **Principal Sir** welcomed us and spoke about the role of *discipline, passion, and enthusiasm* in building a better future.  

I was surprised to learn that the college, established in **1956**, is celebrating its **70th anniversary** this year.
